## Task description

  I attempted to create a solution that simplifies the process of selecting an electricity provider for customers. I developed two pages for this purpose.
 
  The first page serves as an overview, providing customers with valuable information regarding their energy consumption. It visually represents their consumption data and
  categorizes it into weekly, monthly, and yearly segments. This segmentation aims to facilitate customer understanding of their consumption patterns and associated costs.
 
  On the second page, customers can explore the various offers available from different electricity providers. This page presents details such as deal types, contract durations,
  monthly prices, price per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and visual representations of average prices from previous years. These visualizations enable customers to compare the current
  offers with historical pricing trends, helping them assess if they are securing a favorable deal in comparison to past prices.

## Comments
  I was not able to encorporate all the functionality that I wanted. Below is a list of some of the elements that I would have liked to include. 

  Overview page:
  - [ ] Change between week, month, and year on the graph.
  - [ ] Change between consumption and price on the graph.
  - [ ] Incorporate more color into the design.
  - [ ] Change between different years on the average price table.
  - [ ] Compare price paid with other previous deals.
  - [ ] Add real numbers to the consumption section.

  Offers page:
  - [ ] Add a tooltip you can hover over for each of the deal types that explains them.
  - [ ] Add the ability to compare deals.
  - [ ] Created a prettier box around the input section.

  Overall:
  - [ ] Make the site fully responsive.
  - [ ] Add a path-navigation below the header.
